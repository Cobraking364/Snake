# PowerUps
PowerUps have a chance to spawn after a fruit is eaten. Eating a powerUp grants one of three random temporary effects of varying benefit. 

# Settings
- Snakespeed: Variable that decides how fast the snake moves. Higher Snakespeed makes the snake move more times a second.
- Playercount: When more than 1 player is selected, the goal of the game changes from eating the most fruit to surviving the longest. Multiplayer is for playing with other people.
